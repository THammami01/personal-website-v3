## Introduction

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global online mentoring program that introduces new contributors to open source software development. Participants, known as GSoC Contributors, work on a 12+ week programming project with the guidance of mentors from open source organizations.

GSoC provides a valuable learning experience for contributors who are paired with mentors, gaining exposure to real-world projects. Accepted contributors receive a stipend while working their projects and continue to contribute actively to open source communities after the program concludes. Participating organizations benefit by identifying and bringing in new developers, and many new contributors remain involved in open source long after their GSoC experience.

The program aims to inspire developers to engage in open source development, assist open source projects in attracting new developers, generate more open source code, and provide newer developers with exposure to real-world software development practices. GSoC's impact extends beyond the summer, as many participants report increased attractiveness to potential employers and continued involvement in open source as mentors or contributors.

## Tips

- **Research First:**

	Check out the program, read other articles, watch YouTube videos, find out what people think, and learn from their experiences. It all adds up to a successful application.

- **Learn from Previous Programs:**

	Examine past programs, review previous organizations, their project ideas, and the code submitted by contributors. This provides insight into what is expected from you and deepens your understanding of the GSoC program.

- **Familiarize Yourself with the Community:**

	Your journey into the open-source realm is comparable to entering a gathering where everyone appears to know each other. To navigate this experience, immerse yourself in community interactions by actively participating in conversations. Introduce yourself, ask questions, and maintain a humble attitude. Make connections before and during the application period, as a grasp of community dynamics and knowing where to seek assistance are crucial for a successful application.

- **Selecting an Organization:**

	Choosing the appropriate GSoC project begins with self-reflection. Identify your interests, skills, and objectives. Explore the announced organizations and research their missions, sizes, and application processes. Create a list based on your preferences and dive into their projects. Strive to become part of a community that genuinely excites you, as GSoC extends beyond a summer project and evolves into a long-term open-source collaboration commitment.

- **Identify the Right Project:**

	Every GSoC organization presents a Project Ideas page. Explore the proposed projects, narrow down those aligning with your interests, and inquire about their scope. Assess your options by considering community compatibility, available documentation, and support. Transform your chosen project idea into a comprehensive plan through discussions with mentors, and always keep in mind that well-researched original proposals grab attention.

- **Craft a Proposal:**

	Creating a compelling proposal is crucial for success. Adhere to Google's formal requirements, provide complete contact details, and create a title that is both clear and captivating. Emphasize the advantages for the community, specify the expected deliverables, and discuss relevant work. Present personal information concisely but pertinently and follow the organization's guidelines. Tailor proposals to each organization and project, showcasing a deep understanding of the work and its significance.

- **Apply Early:**

	Submitting your application ahead of time comes with the benefit of receiving timely constructive feedback, and helps you avoid falling behind schedule and missing deadlines.

- **Deal with Rejection:**

	Receiving a rejection does not mean the end. Seek feedback on your proposal, understand the reasons behind the decision, and use it as a learning opportunity. Approach organizations about pursuing the project independently, as most if not all still express interest. Stay connected with the community or explore a different organization that aligns better if you wish. Persistence is key; continuously refine your proposals and engagement, as success may come in subsequent attempts!
